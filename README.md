# Libft
This project is a recreation of the C standard library. Used for future WeThinkCode_ projects done in C.

# Getting started
Run 'make'
`$ make`
This will compile all the functions into a `libft.a` library

Compile the included `main.c` file or create your own
`$ gcc -Werror -Wall -Wextra main.c -o main libft.a`

Run the `main` progam created
`$ ./main`

If all goes well, you should see an output comparing the C standard library functions with the ones found here, e.g.:
lkhads
